No attribute of a PRIMARY KEY can ever be NULL in any tuple. But attributes declared UNIQUE may have NULL’s, and there may be several tuples with NULL**.** Two other declarations we can make for an attribute are:\nNOT NULL means that the value for this attribute may never be NULL.

Uniquely identifies each row in a table\nFOREIGN KEY - Prevents actions that would destroy links between tables\nIf there is a foreign-key constraint from attributes of relation R to the primary key of relation S, two violations are possible:\nAn insert or update to R introduces values not found in S. A deletion or update to S causes some tuples of R to “dangle.” Suppose R and S, to handle nonexistent S must be rejected:\nDefault: Reject the modification.\nCascade: Make the same changes in R.\nDeleted Class: delete R tuple.\nUpdated Class: change value in R.\nSet NULL: Change S to NULL.\nWhen we declare a foreign key, we may choose policies SET NULL or CASCADE independently for deletions and updates: ON [UPDATE, DELETE][SET NULL CASCADE]\ne.g.\n// Create table ENROLL // Enroll (snum:integer, cname:String) CREATE TABLE ENROLL ( snum BIGINT, cname VARCHAR(255), FOREIGN KEY (snum) REFERENCES student(snum), FOREIGN KEY (cname) REFERENCES class(cname) on UPDATE CASCADE, primary key(snum, cname)); // FOREIGN KEY on ALTER TABLE ALTER TABLE Orders ADD FOREIGN KEY (PersonID) REFERENCES Persons(PersonID); CHECK - Ensures that the values in a column satisfies a specific condition\nCREATE INDEX - Used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly\nData Manipulation Language (DML): ­Insert new tuples into relations ­Delete tuples from relations Modify various attributes of tuples Query the database INSRET INTO\n// 1.

Early diagnosis is important to prevent more serious consequences. Implementing a detection system would save more time for doctors and give patients efficient and low-cost diagnoses. In this paper, we built a skin cancer classification system based on Convoluted Neural Network (CNN) for seven majority skin cancers, and Natural Language Processing (NLP), for interaction with a human. We also implemented self-defined CNN, LeNet5, AlexNet, ResNet, VGG-16 in our system to compare their accuracy and discover reasons behind those output data. Finally, our self-defined CNN gets 0.8237 testing accuracy after training, LeNet5 results in 0.4857 testing accuracy, AlexNet produces 0.4715 testing accuracy, ResNet yields 0.8995 testing accuracy, and VGG-16 shown 0.7544 testing accuracy. The result indicates that ResNet-18 performs best through all models.","tags":[],"title":"CNN Implementation on Major Skin Cancer Types Classification and NLP Diagnose Robot System","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xizheng (Hugh) Yu","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

You can focus on the content and Wowchemy handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you’ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Wowchemy.\nExamples Code Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax.

You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$...${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} or {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$$...$${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}}, respectively. (We wrap the LaTeX math in the Wowchemy math shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown. The math shortcode is new in v5.5-dev.)\nExample math block:\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$ \\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2} $$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$ Example inline math {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the math linebreak (\\\\):\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$ f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases} $$ Diagrams Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for diagrams.
